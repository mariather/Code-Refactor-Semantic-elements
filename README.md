Project refactor that uses semantic elements on their website's code that provides and improves:

* Meaning
* Structure that follows best standards and practices.
* Accessibility
* Long-term sustainability
* Inclusion

Implementing this new technology of semantic elements instead of "divs," guarantees function over form. This means that people with disabilities or other special requirements can access the website using assistive technologies. 


## Mock-Up
